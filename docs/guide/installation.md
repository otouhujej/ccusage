# Installation

ccusage can be installed and used in several ways depending on your preferences and use case.

## Why No Installation Needed?

Thanks to ccusage's incredibly small bundle size, you don't need to install it globally. Unlike other CLI tools, we pay extreme attention to bundle size optimization, achieving an impressively small footprint even without minification. This means:

- ✅ Near-instant startup times
- ✅ Minimal download overhead
- ✅ Always use the latest version
- ✅ No global pollution of your system

## Quick Start (Recommended)

The fastest way to use ccusage is to run it directly:

::: code-group

```bash [npx]
npx ccusage@latest
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm dlx ccusage
```

```bash [deno]
deno run -E -R=$HOME/.claude/projects/ -S=homedir -N='raw.githubusercontent.com:443' npm:ccusage@latest
```

:::


::: info Deno Security
Consider using `deno run` if you want additional security controls. Deno allows you to specify exact permissions, making it safer to run tools you haven't audited.

### Performance Comparison

Here's why runtime choice matters:

| Runtime | First Run | Subsequent Runs | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-----------------|-------|
| npx | Moderate | Acceptable | Standard npm option |
| pnpm dlx | Fast | Fast | Good alternative |
| deno | Moderate | Fast | Best for security |

## Global Installation (Optional)

While not necessary due to our small bundle size, you can still install ccusage globally if you prefer:

::: code-group

```bash [npm]
npm install -g ccusage
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn global add ccusage
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm add -g ccusage
```

:::

After global installation, run commands directly:

```bash
ccusage daily
ccusage monthly --breakdown
ccusage blocks --live
```

## Development Installation

For development or contributing to ccusage:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ryoppippi/ccusage.git
cd ccusage

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run directly from source
npm run start daily
npm run start monthly --json
```

### Development Scripts

```bash
# Run tests
npm run test

# Type checking
npm run typecheck

# Build distribution
npm run build

# Lint and format
npm run format
```

## Runtime Requirements

### Node.js

- **Minimum**: Node.js 20.x
- **Recommended**: Node.js 20.x or later
- **LTS versions** are fully supported

### Deno

Deno 2.0+ is fully supported with proper permissions:

```bash
deno run \
  -E \
  -R=$HOME/.claude/projects/ \
  -S=homedir \
  -N='raw.githubusercontent.com:443' \
  npm:ccusage@latest
```

Also you can use `offline` mode to run ccusage without network access:

```bash
deno run \
  -E \
  -R=$HOME/.claude/projects/ \
  -S=homedir \
  npm:ccusage@latest --offline
```

## Verification

After installation, verify ccusage is working:

```bash
# Check version
ccusage --version

# Run help command
ccusage --help

# Test with daily report
ccusage daily
```

## Updating

### Direct Execution (npx)

Always gets the latest version automatically.

### Global Installation

```bash
# Update with npm
npm update -g ccusage

```

### Check Current Version

```bash
ccusage --version
```

## Uninstalling

### Global Installation

::: code-group

```bash [npm]
npm uninstall -g ccusage
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn global remove ccusage
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm remove -g ccusage
```

:::

### Development Installation

```bash
# Remove cloned repository
rm -rf ccusage/
```

## Troubleshooting Installation

### Permission Errors

If you get permission errors during global installation:

::: code-group

```bash [npm]
# Use npx instead of global install
npx ccusage@latest

# Or configure npm to use a different directory
npm config set prefix ~/.npm-global
export PATH=~/.npm-global/bin:$PATH
```

```bash [Node Version Managers]
# Use nvm (recommended)
nvm install node
npm install -g ccusage

# Or use fnm
fnm install node
npm install -g ccusage
```

:::

### Network Issues

If installation fails due to network issues:

```bash
# Try with different registry
npm install -g ccusage --registry https://registry.npmjs.org

# Or use npx for offline-capable runs
npx ccusage
```

### Version Conflicts

If you have multiple versions installed:

```bash
# Check which version is being used
which ccusage
ccusage --version

# Uninstall and reinstall
npm uninstall -g ccusage
npm install -g ccusage@latest
```
